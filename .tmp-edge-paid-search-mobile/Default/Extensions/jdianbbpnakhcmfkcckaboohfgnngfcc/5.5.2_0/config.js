/*
 * Shared runtime configuration for the Email Extractor extension.
 *
 * There is no bundler here (unlike the Vite-built finder/tracker extensions), so
 * the environment is chosen from a single build flag instead of build-time env
 * substitution:
 *
 *   - The source tree ships BUILD_ENV = "development", so loading
 *     apps/ext-extractor/ unpacked points at the local dev stack (see .env.example).
 *   - The packaging script (scripts/package.mjs) rewrites the flag to "production"
 *     in the zipped build, so a packaged extension — whether you load the zip
 *     unpacked or publish it to the Web Store — uses the real public hosts.
 *
 * Loaded first in popup.html (before popupv3.js) and via importScripts in the
 * background service worker, so MS_URLS is available to both.

 * Hosts where the repeat scanning stays off.
 *
 * The extractor runs on <all_urls> because autosave is meant to capture emails as you
 * browse. But heavy single-page apps (video, social, chat) churn the DOM constantly, which
 * makes the MutationObserver re-scan the whole page every ~500ms, pinning the CPU and
 * slowing the browser to a crawl. Uninstall feedback called this out by name (youtube.com,
 * messenger.com).
 *
 * What is off here is the repetition, not the extraction: content.js attaches neither the
 * observer nor the focus rescan, but still scans once per page load. These are exactly the
 * hosts people queue up in the automation tool (influencer profiles on tiktok.com,
 * instagram.com and youtube.com carry public contact addresses), and it navigates a tab
 * through a list with no popup to open per page, so dropping the load scan left those runs
 * collecting nothing. Add registrable domains here; subdomains (www., web., mail., …) are
 * matched automatically.
